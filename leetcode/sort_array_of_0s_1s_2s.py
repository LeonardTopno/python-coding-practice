-- Approach
i) It is given that the problem needs to be solved in Linear Time i.e. O(n), this means we should avoid nested loops.
ii) Traversing Loop is allowed

iii) Problem needs to solved in constant space i.e. O(1), this means 
        - No additional DS is to be used, the Problem has to be solved in-place, changes(swapping) has be be done in the existing DS (array) only while traversing
        - and no return statement
        

-- Leo's Analysis:
i) The Time Complexity of Above Solution is O(n), where n is the number of elems in the input array. And it has been solved in one pass only.
ii) Space Complexity is O(1)
